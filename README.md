# GeneralTree
Find leaf nodes whose paths from the root add up to specified sum.

This problem came up while talking with a software engineer.
In general most people deal with binary trees. In this case
the problme is based on a `general tree`.

Our goal is to determine if there are leaf nodes in the tree
that add up to a specified value. If so, we need to return a
string with the leaf nodes.

If interested in a better description of the problem and my
approach to solve it, I invite you to read the following post
in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read and
experiment. Practice should mek you perfect; at least that is what
I have been told.

Enjoy;
